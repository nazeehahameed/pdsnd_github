2. A text editor, like Sublime or Atom<br/>
3. A terminal application<br/>

**<font size="5">Description</font>**

This project is to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United States—Chicago, New York City, and Washington using Python. I have written a code to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. Also a script is included that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

**<font size="3">Questions Explored</font>**

The script answers the following questions about the bike share data:

1. What is the most popular month for start time?<br/>
2. What is the most popular day of week (Monday, Tuesday, etc.) for start time?<br/>
3. What is the most popular hour of day for start time?<br/>
4. What is the total trip duration and average trip duration?<br/>
5. What is the most popular start station and most popular end station?<br/>
6. What is the most popular trip?<br/>
What are the counts of each user type?<br/>
7. What are the counts of gender?<br/>
8. What are the earliest (i.e. oldest person), most recent (i.e. youngest person), and most popular birth years?<br/>

**<font size="5">Files Used</font>**

The three files used in this project are the following:
1. chicago.csv<br/>
2. new_york_city.csv<br/>
3. washington.csv<br/>
