#**Project Title**
Programming for Data Science Nanodegree Program - Explore-US-Bikeshare-Data

#**Description**
This project is to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United States—Chicago, New York City, and Washington using Python. I have written a code to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. Also a script is included that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

##*Questions explored*

The script answers the following questions about the bike share data:

What is the most popular month for start time?
What is the most popular day of week (Monday, Tuesday, etc.) for start time?
What is the most popular hour of day for start time?
What is the total trip duration and average trip duration?
What is the most popular start station and most popular end station?
What is the most popular trip?
What are the counts of each user type?
What are the counts of gender?
What are the earliest (i.e. oldest person), most recent (i.e. youngest person), and most popular birth years?

#**Files used**
The three files used in this project are the following:
chicago.csv
new_york_city.csv
washington.csv
